##Docker London

[Docker London](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-London/) is a great MeetUp - friendly, brilliantly organised and with a constant stream of good content.

I've presented:

- Introduction to Docker for the 3rd Birthday Party
- [Docker Swarm Mode in Docker 1.12](docker-swarm-is-dead/README.md) after DockerCon 2016
- [Docker and Windows: The State of the Union](docker-windows-state-union/demo-cheatsheet.md), in February 2017
